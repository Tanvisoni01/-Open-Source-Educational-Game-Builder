# Open Source Educational Game Builder

## Project Title
Open Source Educational Game Builder

## Project Description
The Open Source Educational Game Builder is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to create, manage, and share educational games in a secure and transparent environment. This platform enables creators to upload their games as smart contracts and provide others with easy access to view, play, and update the game content. The use of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for storing game assets ensures that the games are decentralized and accessible to anyone.

## Contract Address
0x3E7E6Aa963f5f9c368F1DA58f58E3c0a7C3E50d1


## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to empower educators, developers, and hobbyists to create educational games that can be shared and built upon by the community. By making the platform open-source and decentralized, we hope to foster collaboration and innovation in educational game development, making learning more interactive and accessible.

## Key Features
- **Game Creation:** Users can create new educational games by providing a name, description, and a link to the game’s assets or content stored on IPFS.
- **Game Management:** Creators can update the content of their games and delete games they no longer wish to share.
- **Ownership:** Each game is owned by the creator, who has exclusive rights to manage and update the content. The creator is identified by their Ethereum address.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Game assets are stored off-chain on IPFS, ensuring that the content remains accessible even if the platform experiences downtime.
- **Game Discovery:** Users can easily search and view games created by others. Each user’s games are tracked and can be accessed via their Ethereum address.
- **Transparent:** The smart contract ensures that all transactions are transparent and publicly verifiable on the blockchain.

## Future Development
In the future, we plan to expand this platform with the following features:
- **Multi-language support** for wider accessibility.
- **In-game interaction** to allow users to play games directly from the platform.
- **Community voting** to allow the community to vote on new games or improvements.
- **Reward system** to incentivize game creators and users to contribute.
